// cobra gives `taskui completion zsh` away free, and what it gives away completes flag
// *names* and stops — which is the half you did not need, since you can see the flags in
// `--help`. What you cannot see is the hundred task names in somebody else's Taskfile, and
// that is precisely what this program already knows how to discover.

// The flag names that more than one file has to agree on: what completes a task name, and
// what the man page calls its placeholder. Named because the two would otherwise be two
// spellings of the same decision, and only one of them would get updated.
