// `--quickfix` prints a run's failures as absolute `file:line:col: message`, which is the
// one form every editor already knows how to walk.
//
// Nothing else can produce it. `go test` prints `order_test.go:88` relative to the
// directory the test ran in; an editor resolves that against its own working directory and
// the jump opens nothing. taskui knows which task printed the line and where that task ran,
// and `loc.Resolver` turns the reference into an absolute path — which it already did, for
// the `e` key. This is that answer, addressed to something other than a person:
//
//	set errorformat=%f:%l:%c:\ %m
//	:cexpr system('taskui --quickfix')
