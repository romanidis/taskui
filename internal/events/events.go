// Package events is taskui's run, addressed to another program.
//
// Two callers, one shape. `--run <task> --json` writes the stream to stdout and exits with
// the run; `--events <path>` writes it from inside the TUI to a socket somebody else is
// listening on, so an editor hosting the terminal can fill a quickfix list, colour a
// statusline and open the file a failure named — without reimplementing any of it.
//
// The events are differences against a run's own state rather than the engine's internal
// event stream. That is deliberate: [github.com/romanidis/taskui/internal/run.Run.Poll]
// folds raw events into state — a line arriving is also a task starting — and a consumer
// wants the folded version. "Task went from pending to running" has no event of its own and
// is exactly what a front end draws.
