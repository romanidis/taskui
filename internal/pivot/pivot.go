// A bucket that exists only because its members did not group is not a group.

// Both trees used to end in one. The domain tree pooled every unnamespaced task into
// `(root)`, and the verb tree pooled every verb answered once into `(other)`; folds start
// closed, so on the first frame both were a single row whose label named nothing but the
// absence of a grouping. In the domain tree that row hid `all`, `fmt`, `test`, `build` —
// the tasks a Taskfile exists to run — behind the one heading on screen that says least
// about what is under it. In the verb tree it hid whatever the transpose had failed to
// find a concern in, which is the half of the list you did not already know about.
//
// So they are not folds any more. A task with nothing to group with is a top-level row of
// its own, and the position those buckets carried survives as a Rank: unnamespaced tasks
// open the domain tree, once-answered verbs close the verb tree. Same rows, same order,
// one less keypress and one less label that means nothing.
