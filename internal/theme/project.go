// A project's own config, and the one rule that makes it safe.
//
// `pin:` and `pivots:` are statements about a particular task list — which tasks are the
// ones you actually run, and how this repository's names group — and they have been living
// in a single global file, where they apply to every project you open. `.taskui-danger` and
// `.taskui-cover` already established that a repository may say things about itself.
//
// The rule is that a project may **add, never override**. Config in a repository is config
// you did not write and did not read: a theme from somebody else's checkout taking over
// your terminal, or their `keys:` block moving `q` while you are holding it, is a surprise
// and not a feature. Extra pivots and extra pins are additive, visible in the header the
// moment they take effect, and cost you nothing if you ignore them. Everything else is
// refused out loud — a key that silently did nothing would be worse than one that says why.

// ProjectFiles are the names a project's own config may be written under, in the order they
// are looked for. Two spellings because YAML in the wild uses both, and a file that is
// ignored for its extension is a bug report.
