// Package search searches captured output, live and archived.
//
// This uses Go's own `regexp` and a line loop over `bufio` rather than shelling out to a
// grep. The point is not raw speed; it is that one matcher covers both corpora. The live
// run is in memory and the archive is on disk, and if those two were searched by different
// code they would drift apart in case handling, regex dialect and match semantics — the
// sort of difference a user notices and cannot articulate.
