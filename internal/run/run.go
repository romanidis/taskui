// Package run runs a task and splits its output back apart, one bucket per task.
//
// `task` writes a single stream. We drive it with `--output prefixed`, which tags every
// output line with the task that produced it, and pair that with the execution graph from
// the graph package — the stream says who spoke, the graph says who called whom.
//
// Colour needs care. `--output prefixed` makes go-task pipe every command through its own
// prefixing writer, so a command's stdout is a pipe regardless of what taskui does —
// measured: isatty reports false inside prefixed mode even when go-task itself is on a
// pty. Tools that auto-detect therefore turn colour off, and no amount of pty gets it
// back. Forcing it by environment does: `CARGO_TERM_COLOR=always` restores cargo and
// clippy's colour through the pipe intact.
//
// The pty is still worth having — it keeps go-task's own output coloured and stops the
// usual switch to block buffering when stdout is not a terminal — it just is not what
// makes the tools colour.
