// Package cover answers the one claim a Taskfile makes that nothing else can check: that an
// aggregate covers what its name says it covers.
//
// `task test` says "Run all automated tests" and runs `deps: [backend:test]`. Whether that
// is the whole truth depends on which namespaces have a `test` and which of them the
// execution graph actually reaches, and those are two facts kept in different files with a
// `desc:` string in between claiming they agree. Nothing checks the claim: go-task runs
// what it is told, yamllint reads syntax, and the description is prose.
//
// taskui already holds both halves — `internal/task` for the flat list of colon paths,
// `internal/graph` for what a root reaches — so the check is the set difference between
// them, and this package is the difference plus a way to say "that one is on purpose".
//
// Reachability, not names, is what makes it correct. xerum's `lint` never calls `api:lint`;
// it calls `api:check`, which reaches `api:tenant:lint` two levels down. A check that
// matched names would report that as a gap and be wrong.
//
// It lives here rather than beside `--lint` because two things ask the question now. The
// picker annotates a namespace with the aggregates that reach it, `--lint` prints the ones
// that do not, and a namespace the tree calls covered while the linter calls it a gap would
// be a tool arguing with itself.
