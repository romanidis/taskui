// Re-reading the Taskfile when it changes.
//
// The list was read once, at startup, and never again — while `e` opens the very file it
// was read from, in your editor, from inside the program. So the intended loop was already
// "edit the Taskfile, come back", and coming back showed the list from before you edited:
// a task you had just added was not there, and a renamed one was still there under its old
// name until you quit.
//
// Watched by name rather than by walking the project, for the reason the tree walk exists:
// a Taskfile sits at the top of a directory whose build output churns, and a watcher on all
// of it would fire on every artefact. The files are known — go-task's own listing names the
// file each task is written in, which is how `includes:` are picked up as well.
//
// Re-reading is `task --list-all` again, which is the cheap call (~76ms); the JSON listing
// and the coverage walk are the expensive ones and are restarted in the background exactly
// as they were at startup.

// reloaded is the answer to one re-read: a new list, or the reason there is not one.
