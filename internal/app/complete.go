// Completion for the args prompt.
//
// Half a real Taskfile needs arguments, and the prompt already knows which ones: it opens
// pre-filled with the `requires: vars` the task declares. What it could not do was finish
// a *value* — the path you are pointing at, or the `ENV=staging` you typed last Tuesday —
// so a prompt that knew the shape of the answer still made you type all of it, exactly.
//
// Three sources, in the order they are worth offering:
//
//   - the variables the task asks for, which is a declaration and therefore certain;
//   - the arguments this same task was actually run with before, out of the archive —
//     the strongest signal there is, because you chose it once already;
//   - files and directories under the project, for the arguments that are paths.
//
// Cycling rather than a longest-common-prefix insert: this is one footer line, the
// candidate is shown in place as you tab through it, and a prefix insert that stops on an
// ambiguity would need somewhere else to say why it stopped.

// argsCompletion is one run of ⇥-completion: the input either side of the word being
// completed, and where in the candidates we are.
//
// The two halves are captured when the cycle is armed rather than recomputed per keypress,
// so tabbing past a candidate longer than the word cannot walk the boundaries.
