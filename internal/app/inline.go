// `⏎` used to leave the list: the run took the screen, and the tasks you were looking at
// went away. It no longer does. Everything the run view knows how to draw is drawn under
// the row the run was started from instead, so starting something costs you neither your
// place in the list nor sight of what you started — and with several slots open, several
// tasks are showing their output at once, which is a thing the run view cannot do at all.
// `v` is still the whole screen, for reading.
//
// The rows are the run view's own [RunRow]s, walked out of the graph by the same function,
// so the two views cannot disagree about what a run contains. The fold states are the run's
// own too, for the same reason: a task opened here is open there.
