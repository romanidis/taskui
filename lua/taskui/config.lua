-- own — and a nested option is one the user has to remember the path to.

---@class Taskui.Config
---@field binary string Executable name or absolute path.
---@field project string|nil Directory to open taskui in. Nil means the cwd.
---@field position "float"|"left"|"right"|"top"|"bottom"|"tab" Where the terminal opens.
---@field width integer Columns for a left or right split.
---@field height integer Rows for a top or bottom split.
---@field args string[] Extra arguments for the binary, e.g. { "--theme", "y2k" }.
---@field quickfix "on_failure"|"always"|"never" When a finished run fills the quickfix list.
---@field open_quickfix boolean Open the quickfix window when it is filled from a failure.
---@field notify boolean Say how a run went — for when the terminal is not the window you are in.
---@field keys table<string, string|false> The two keys the host owns inside the terminal; the rest belong to taskui.
---@field jump_key string taskui's own jump key, which `run()` types to reach a task. Set it if your config moves it.

  -- goes to. It is here so that a `keys: jump:` line in a taskui config has
