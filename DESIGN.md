# Design notes

Why taskui works the way it does. The [README](README.md) covers what it is and how to
drive it; this is the reasoning underneath, kept because the decisions here were the
expensive part and a decision without its reason is just a constraint.


## Notes on the design

A node can be **both a group and a task**. `backend:migrate` applies migrations *and*
parents `backend:migrate:down`, `:prod`, `:status`, `:schema`. Collapsing those into one
concept loses one of them, so `Node` carries `task` and `children` independently.

This is why `space` and `⏎` are kept strictly separate rather than one key that folds
groups and runs leaves. `⏎` on `▸ migrate  5` runs it from its own header, so the subtree
never has to relist the task just to make it reachable.

**Domain and file are not the same thing.** In atlas, `sec:*` and `wt:*` are namespaced
inline in the root `Taskfile.yml` rather than included from their own files, so "which
namespace is this in" and "where do I go to edit it" have different answers. A file pivot
is a few lines away — `location.taskfile` is already parsed — but it is not wired up yet.

**`*:default` tasks become their namespace row.** `dev:default` is what `task dev` runs, so
it is listed as `dev` and lands on the `dev` group row, which is then runnable — the same
shape as a root-level `sec` beside `sec:secrets`. A `default` row underneath would be noise
in a UI where the namespace is itself a selectable row; a namespace row that cannot be run
when `task dev` starts the whole product is a hole. The root `default` has no name to run
it by and stays out.

**Production tasks are flagged `⚠` and need a confirmation.** `⏎` runs things for real and
a fuzzy filter puts every task one keypress away, so the dangerous ones stop and ask:

```
  ⚠   run task infra:deploy  —  this one touches production.  y to run, anything else cancels
```

Which tasks those are comes from a `.taskui-danger` file in the project root: one pattern
per line, `*` matches any characters, `#` comments. Its presence switches off the
description heuristic **entirely** — a guess and a declaration disagreeing about which
tasks are dangerous is worse than either alone, so once the list is written down, the list
is the answer.

With no such file, the old heuristic over names and descriptions applies, which both over-
and under-matches. atlas's list flags 18 of 122 tasks; the heuristic caught
`infra:deploy:plan` too, which is explicitly read-only.

**Filtering is fuzzy over the full colon path**, so `blint` finds `backend:lint`. It will
also occasionally surprise you — `lint` matches `api:gen:client` — the price of fuzzy
matching. Matches keep tree order rather than score order, because the tree *is* the
organisation and resorting it by score would destroy the grouping you are looking at.

## Runs

`⏎` starts `task <name>` and stays where you are. The run unfolds **under the row it came
from**: the tasks it pulled in, the commands each of those ran, and a window on the last few
lines each of them printed.

```

Taking the screen was the old behaviour, and it was wrong in the way that only shows after a
week of use: every run cost you your place. Starting a second task meant `esc`, find the row
again, `⏎` — and watching two at once was impossible even though the slots underneath had
always held six. The list is what you navigate by, and a run is something that happens *to a
task in it*, so that is where it is drawn. A batch of three marked tasks is now three blocks
of live output in one list, which is the one shape the run view cannot show: it has one run
on screen at a time.

`v` gives a run the whole screen. That is where you read one — the header carries the exit
code and the total, the columns split when the output is wide enough to want them, and
nothing else on the screen is competing for rows.

**The block is not a fourth piece of state.** How much of a run the picker is showing is read
back off the folds the run already has: every task hidden is a hidden block, every task open
is an open one, anything else is a peek. A separate field would be one the run view could
contradict — open a task there, come back, and the row would claim to be closed while showing
you output. For the same reason the folds themselves belong to the *slot* rather than to the
screen, so a task you unfolded in the list is unfolded when you press `v`.

**`space` is the tree, `o` is the output.** Two fold keys, because with a run under a row
there are two things a fold key could mean, and a node that is both a group and a task
(`backend:migrate`) can have both at once. Each falls through to the other where it has
nothing of its own to fold, which is most rows — a leaf has no group to open and a namespace
with nothing running has no output — so on the rows where only one meaning exists, either key
does the obvious thing. Inside a block, the same `o` moves one task rather than the run.

The rows are the run view's own, walked out of the graph by the same function, so the two
views cannot disagree about what a run contains. They differ in what surrounds the rows.

### The run view

The same tree, with the screen to itself: each task's status and duration, and the same
window on the last few lines it printed.

```

        3 └       order_test.go:88: want 1200, got 1180
```

Every task carries its own clock, ticking while it runs rather than appearing only once it
finishes — during a slow build the useful question is *which step* is slow, and the total
in the header cannot answer it. Durations are formatted to be read at a glance: `4ms`,
`1.5s`, `2m14s`, rather than `0.00s` and `134.20s`.

Output lines are rows of the same list as the tasks that produced them, which is what lets
one fold tree hold both.

### Commands carry their own verdict

go-task announces each command before running it — `task: [test] cargo test --workspace` —
and says nothing when it returns. That echo is structure rather than output, which is why it
was already marked as such and drawn with a `❯` rather than left looking like a line the
command printed.

It now carries how that step went as well: `▶` while it is running, `✓` once the next one
started, `✗` on the one that took the task down. There is no event for any of that, so the
verdict is read off the shape of what came after — another echo means this one returned, and
the last echo shares the task's own status. A failure the Taskfile swallows (`ignore_error:`)
therefore reads as a success, which from outside is exactly what it is: go-task went on to
the next command.

Its output hangs off it, on a rail that runs down the marker column and closes at the last
line before the next command starts — so which lines belong to which step is something you
see rather than something you count.

That is a **reversal**, and worth saying so. Output used to get no marker at all, on the
grounds that absence of a marker is itself a marker and a `│` on every line of a build log
is a column of chrome you stop seeing but keep paying for. That was right while a command
echo was only a label. It stopped being right the moment the echo became a step with a
status: once a row says `✗ ❯ go test ./...`, "and which of the next forty lines is that
one's" is a question the screen has raised and has to answer.

The rail is drawn from the whole buffer rather than from what is on screen, so a peek window
on the end of a command's output still says the lines belong to something above it. Inside a
task, the same guide vocabulary continues outward: tasks hang off their parent, and in the
picker the whole run hangs off the row it was started from, by the same `├ │ └` the task
tree already draws with.

"Which step is this", "how did that step go" and "what did it print" are the three questions
a build log gets read with, and the first two used to be answerable only by finding where
the output stopped. On a task with eight commands that is eight guesses, and the answer
moves every time something prints.

### The peek window

Folded used to mean empty, and empty is not an answer. A run of 26 nodes collapsed to 26
rows tells you what ran and how long it took, and to find out whether any of it is worth
reading you open them one at a time and guess. So `space`/`o` walks **three** states rather
than two, and the resting one shows something:

| glyph | state | what you get |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `▸` | hidden | the task, its status, its duration, `34 lines` |
| `▿` | **peek** | the last 5 lines, one row each, and `29 more` |
| `▾` | full | all of it, wrapped |

The peek is a **window on the end** of the buffer, not the start. A command's output puts
its verdict last — the assertion, the stack frame, the "3 migrations pending" — and a task
still going has its news at the bottom by definition. It tails: what is in the window is
whatever arrived most recently, so a peeking `docker compose logs -f` is a live five-line
view of the stack while you work on something else.

Peeked lines are **cut at the edge rather than wrapped**, which is the trade the window
makes: five lines has to mean five lines, and one 300-character stack frame wrapped into
nine rows would mean showing one of them. Open it fully and wrapping comes back — that is
the mode you read in, and the one where a search hit past column 100 has to be visible.

Five is a default, not a law: `peek-lines:` in `config.yaml` sets it, because how much is
enough is a property of the tools you run.

`⇧O` moves every task at once, along the same cycle. Mixed states go to full first, since
mixed almost always means *I opened two of these and now want the rest*.

Output lines are numbered per task, and in full they wrap rather than truncate. Go's own tools and
anything you run through them emit lines well past 100 columns, and a line cut at the terminal edge can still
*match a search* — a hit you cannot see is worse than no hit at all. Wrapping prefers word
boundaries and hard-splits tokens too long to fit, so a long type signature stays
readable. Continuation rows keep a blank gutter so the numbers stay scannable.

The view follows whatever is running, and the moment something fails it unfolds that task
and parks there. Any deliberate cursor move turns following off — once you have gone
looking for something, the view should stop moving under you. `w` turns it back on.

Following moves the cursor **and nothing else**. It does not open what is running: every
task already rests on a window of its own last few lines, so the live one is showing its
latest output wherever it sits, and expanding it would push the twenty-five windows around
it off the screen — which is the whole reason to watch a run instead of tailing a log. A
fold you set yourself is yours, and following will not overrule it when the next task
starts.

And it does not move the cursor at all when the cursor is **already inside the task it
would follow**. Following exists to bring what is running into view; a task whose lines you
are sitting in is in view. Without that rule, reading an open task while it prints meant
being dragged back to its header once per line — which is what `⇧G` on a live run did,
since jumping to the end turns following back on.

Reading is likewise not disturbed by output arriving elsewhere. The cursor tracks the line
it is *on*, not the row number it happens to sit at, so a task higher up the tree printing
another hundred lines no longer slides the stack trace you are halfway through out from
under you.

`r` re-runs the task under the cursor, including when the cursor is on one of its output
lines. Note that this is a fresh `task <name>` and not a resume of the parent pipeline
from that point: go-task exposes no resume, and pretending otherwise would be a lie.

`⇧R` is the same re-run with `--force`. Plain `r` inherits the flags the run was started
with, so a task go-task considers up to date declines to run and hands back a tick that
proves nothing. `⇧R` is what you wanted the second time you pressed `r`. The override only
adds: `r` on a run that was already forced stays forced. It forces that re-run and nothing
after it.

`esc` leaves the run view without stopping the run — it carries on, and the picker header
says so. `x` stops it.

Stopping means signalling the **process group**, not the `task` process. Killing `task`
alone leaves the shell commands beneath it running: verified by killing taskui mid-run and
watching `sleep` carry on afterwards. The pty puts the child in its own session, so the
group can be signalled at once, which is what actually reaps the tree. The same happens
when a `Run` is dropped, and `q` walks every open run on the way out — the focused one and
every parked one — so quitting cannot silently orphan a container. Because that reaches
runs you are not looking at, `q` asks first whenever anything is still going.

The first signal is a **SIGTERM**, deliberately, because it can be caught: `docker compose
up` reads it as "take the containers down", and skipping it would leave the stack up while
taskui reported it stopped.

Which is also the problem. Things that catch SIGTERM can decline to act on it — a `trap`
in a shell script, a runtime blocked on a call that is never going to return — and one of
them outliving the run it belonged to is exactly the orphan this is all here to prevent.
So there are two answers:

- **A second `x`** sends **SIGKILL**, which cannot be caught. The run view says so while
  it is stopping rather than making you guess whether the first press landed.
- **Anything left in the group** a moment after go-task itself has gone is taken with
  SIGKILL regardless. This has to happen where it does — in the capture thread, between
  the output ending and the child being waited on — because waiting on the child releases
  its pid, and that pid is the group's only name. A moment later it names somebody else.

That second one applies only to a run you *stopped*. A run that ended on its own may have
left something behind entirely on purpose — `docker compose up -d` is a task whose whole
job is to outlive itself — and killing that would be tearing down a stack as a reward for
succeeding.

The one case nothing can cover is taskui being killed from outside — `kill -9` runs no
destructors, in any program — so an externally-killed taskui does still leave its build
running.

Two pieces of machinery make this work, and neither is obvious.

**Which task produced this line** comes from `--output prefixed`, which tags every output
line at the source. See below for why the alternatives do not work.

**Who called whom** comes from `task --summary`, recursed from the invoked root. The
`--list-all --json` output carries no dependencies, so the alternative was parsing seven
Taskfiles and reimplementing `includes:` resolution. `--summary` reports a task's direct
edges using go-task's own resolver, which costs one process per node — about 1.3s for
atlas's 26-node `all` — and cannot drift from what go-task actually does. It runs on a
worker thread, so the tree appears greyed-out immediately rather than freezing the UI.

A task reached by two paths is one node in the graph and gets one row: atlas's `app:css`
is invoked by both `check` and `build`, and showing it twice would imply it ran twice.

### Long-running tasks

Tasks that do not end are fine here — `docker compose up`, `docker compose logs -f`, a dev
server, a `tail -f`. Leave one up and keep working: **runs live in slots, one per task
name, and starting a different task no longer disturbs the one already going.**

```
 taskui ▸ task test                                            RUNNING    2.1s
  1 ▶ logs 41m12s   2 ▶ test 2.1s   3 ✓ lint 3.4s
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

The bar appears once there is a second run to switch to. `⇥` and `⇧⇥` cycle, `1`…`9` jump
straight to a slot, and each slot keeps its own scroll position, folds and follow state —
coming back to a stack you left up an hour ago should not mean coming back to the top of
its log. Six slots; a finished one is recycled automatically when you need a seventh, a
live one never is.

Everything keeps draining while it is parked, so nothing is lost while you are looking
somewhere else, and a background run archives itself the moment it ends — the status line
says so rather than making you go and check. From the picker, the header counts what is
still going, and names it when there is only one.

**And the rows themselves say what is running.** A task with a live slot shows `▶` and a
ticking elapsed time in place of its outcome column — the same reading as the slot bar's, so
the two agree at a glance. Previously that column only ever answered *how did it go last
time*, which meant a task running this second looked exactly like one that ran yesterday:
the footer could say `3 running` while every row in front of you showed nothing but history.
Running now displaces the historical mark rather than sitting beside it, because it is the
more urgent of the two questions; once the run ends the row goes back to reporting how it
went.

**`v` goes to what is running**, not to whichever slot you left last. If the slot on screen
is already live it stays put; otherwise it takes the earliest-started live one, so pressing
`v` twice lands in the same place rather than hopping between two running tasks. With
nothing live it falls back to the last run — *what just happened* being the useful answer
when there is nothing to watch.

**Stopping one you are not looking at** does not mean going to look at it first. `x` in the
picker stops whichever slot holds the task under the cursor — from there nothing is on
screen, so every run is a background run, and loading a 20,000-line buffer to press one key
is not a reasonable toll. `⇧K` stops every slot at once without leaving taskui. Both ask
before taking down more than the run in front of you.

Output is capped at 20,000 lines per task, dropped in blocks from the oldest end and
counted, so the row says `12000 earlier dropped` rather than quietly presenting a
truncated log as the whole thing. Without the cap a tailed container log is a few hundred
bytes a line for as long as you leave it up, which is gigabytes by the afternoon.

Two things are worth knowing. A run that never ends is never archived — stopping it with
`x` writes it out, but until then it exists only in memory. And there is still no detach:
`q` stops every slot, because a container left behind by a tool that has exited is exactly
the orphan the process-group handling above exists to prevent. Quitting therefore waits for
those groups to actually be gone rather than signalling them and walking away, which is a
second or so with a stack up.

For **running tasks against a stack you have up**, split the finite part from the infinite
one so go-task can still order them:

```yaml
tasks:
  up:    { cmds: ["docker compose up -d --wait"] }   # exits when healthy — deps-able
  logs:  { cmds: ["docker compose logs -f"] }        # the one that owns a slot
  test:  { deps: [up], cmds: ["docker compose exec -T app pytest"] }
```

`deps: [up]` can never work against a foreground `docker compose up`, because it never
returns; `--wait` makes readiness go-task's problem, which it is good at. The `-T` matters
for the reason described under [Why `--output prefixed`](#why---output-prefixed): every
command runs behind go-task's prefixing pipe, so `exec` without `-T` refuses with "the
input device is not a TTY".

## Searching output

`/` searches what the tasks printed. Note this is a *different* search from `/` in the
picker, which fuzzy-matches 122 short task names; this one runs a regex over potentially
megabytes of output, so the two get separate affordances despite the shared key.

There are two jobs and two keys, because "take me to the next one" and "hide everything
that is not one" are different things.

`/` is jump-to-match. `n` and `N` step through hits in execution order — the order the run
happened, not alphabetical — opening whatever fold is hiding each one.

`f` is the filter. Pressed with nothing running it opens its own prompt and narrows the
run live as you type; pressed while a query is active it toggles the filtered view on and
off, so you can search first and convert afterwards if that is how you got there. Either
way the run collapses to just the matching lines, kept under the tasks that produced them,
with tasks that have no hits dropped entirely:

```
 taskui ▸ task ci      /pending  1/2  filtered ±2    FAILED    0.2s   exit 201
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   ▾ ✗ test                                                            0.03s
      8   3 migrations pending, refusing to start
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 filter: pending█   2 matches in 1 task   ⏎ keep   esc clear
```

Backspacing to an empty pattern shows the whole run again without leaving filter mode, so
you can widen and re-narrow without starting over.

Matching is smart-case, as in ripgrep: `fail` finds `FAIL`, `FAIL` does not drag in
`fail`. Patterns are full regexes, and a half-typed one reports quietly rather than
clearing your results — incremental search spends most of its time on invalid input.

Search runs over the ANSI-stripped text, never the raw bytes. Searching the raw bytes
would miss a match wherever a colour change lands mid-word — `\x1b[31merr\x1b[0mor` does
not contain `error` — which is a bug you would never think to look for.

## Stored runs

Every finished run is written to `$XDG_STATE_HOME/taskui/runs/` (or
`~/.local/state/taskui/runs/`), last 50 kept. The format is deliberately boring: a
`manifest.json` for the structure, plus `<task>.txt` (stripped, searchable) and
`<task>.ansi` (colour intact) per task. Plain `grep` works on it, which is the point — a
format that needs taskui to read it would be a worse format.

`taskui --search PATTERN` greps the lot, newest first, grouped by run and task:

```
✗ 1787688604-ci  task ci  (2 hits)
  test
        8  3 migrations pending, refusing to start

✗ 1787688594-ci  task ci  (2 hits)
  test
        8  3 migrations pending, refusing to start
```

That answers "when did this start failing", which is the question you cannot ask today.

### Redaction

`task --summary` prints the resolved environment, so for a Taskfile with `dotenv:` it
prints real credentials — against atlas's `lint` it emits live Cloudflare and Google
values. taskui runs that command to build the graph, and it stores run output on disk, so
without care it would write your secrets into `~/.local/state/`.

Redaction happens in the capture thread, before a line reaches the UI, the buffers or the
disk — nothing unmasked is ever put on the channel, so no later code path can leak what it
never received. The secret list is harvested from that same `--summary` env dump: the leak
is also the best available list of what to plug. Every task's dump, not only the root's —
`all` calling a `deploy` whose own `env:` carries the token prints it from `deploy`. And
one thing the dump never shows is a Taskfile's plain top-level `env:`, so that is read from
the Taskfiles themselves. Values produced by `sh:` or templates are the exception: neither
dump nor file holds them, so they are not masked. Run directories are `0700` and files
`0600` regardless.

Two more sources, both found by a secret getting through. Arguments: `API_TOKEN=sk-…` typed
at the args prompt is a variable to go-task like any other, and it is masked in the output
and in the command line the manifest and the history ledger keep. And a value with newlines
in it — a private key in `env:` — is masked line by line, since masking works a line at a
time and the whole key never appears on one.

A secret can also be hidden by colour. `grep` highlighting the `sk-` it was asked for puts
an escape inside the value, and stripping escapes for the searchable text rebuilds it — so
each line is masked in both forms, and one whose plain form still held a secret keeps the
plain form and loses its colour.

The masking rule is deliberately conservative. A value is masked when its variable name
looks like a credential (`*_TOKEN`, `*_SECRET`, `*_KEY`, `*_PASSWORD`, …) or the value
carries a known credential prefix (`cfut_`, `ghp_`, `sk-`, `AKIA`, `-----BEGIN`) — and
only when it is at least 8 characters and not a boolean. Masking `LOG_REDACT_PII=false`
would replace the word `false` everywhere it legitimately appears, which is worse than the
problem. The run view reports how many secrets it masked, so zero reads as *zero found*
rather than as *checked and clean*.

### History

`h` lists what has already run, newest first, **scoped to the current project** — the
manifest records which directory a run came from, and one list mixing every repo you have
ever used taskui in stops being useful immediately. `a` widens to all projects.

`/` greps every stored run and keeps only the ones that matched, with hit counts:

```
 taskui ▸ history               all projects   /migrations   4 runs   4 failed
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
▌✗ 9m ago    task ci                      0.16s      14 lines   2 hits
 ✗ 42m ago   task ci                      0.18s      14 lines   2 hits
```

That is the "when did this start failing" question. `⏎` opens a matched run with the same
query already applied, so you land on the thing you were looking for.

```
 taskui ▸ history                                    atlas   3 runs   2 failed
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
▌✓ 3m ago    task leak                    0.10s       4 lines
 ✗ 5m ago    task ci                      0.18s      14 lines
 ✗ 5m ago    task ci                      0.19s      14 lines
```

`⏎` reopens one into the ordinary run view — same folding, same search — because it *is*
the same structure, read back off disk rather than off a pty. It opens on the failure,
since that is nearly always why you went looking. Colour survives the round trip: the
`.txt` half is what search matches on, the `.ansi` half is what renders.

`is_command` is not stored, because a marker in the `.txt` file would make the archive
worse to grep. It is recomputed on load from the shape of go-task's own echo line.

## Acting on what you found

The three screens above stop one step short of what you actually want. They get you to
"`test` failed and here is what it said"; what you wanted was to be in the file. These
close that gap.

### Locations

Every compiler, test runner and linter prints `file:line`. Finding them is a regular
expression; the decision worth writing down is that **the extension is required**.

Without it, every duration (`12:34`), timestamp (`10:30:45`) and port (`localhost:8080`) in
a build log becomes a candidate. A highlight that lands on a third of the numbers on screen
is a highlight you learn to ignore, and then the feature has negative value: it has taught
you to distrust a signal that is usually right. With the extension required, a false
positive has to look like a filename, which in practice means it is one.

Whether the file *exists* is a much better filter still, and it is deliberately not used
for the highlight. That check runs on every visible row of every frame — sixty stats a
frame, twenty frames a second — to answer a question that only matters once, when a key is
actually pressed. So the renderer decides syntactically and the jump decides for real.

Resolving is the part with the interesting failure. Go's own test output is:

```
--- FAIL: TestWrap (0.00s)
    view_test.go:88: want 3, got 4
```

`view_test.go` is relative to the *package* directory. That is not the directory the run
started in, and nothing in the line says which package it was. Resolving it against the
project root fails, and failing there would make every Go test failure — the single most
common thing this feature exists for — unreachable.

So a path that does not resolve directly is looked up by basename in an index of the
project, built on first use and never for a session that does not press `e`. Two files
sharing a name resolve to the shallower, and Resolve reports that it had to guess so the
status line can say so. Silently opening the wrong file is the one outcome worse than
opening nothing.

The editor argv is per-editor rather than a bare `$EDITOR file`, because an editor that
opens at line 1 when the output said line 212 has done the tedious half of the job. An
unrecognised editor gets the file and no line number: `+N` is close to universal among
terminal editors, and "close to" is not good enough when being wrong means the editor reads
it as a second filename and creates it.

Terminal editors get the terminal handed over and the UI redraws afterwards; windowed ones
are started alongside. Handing the terminal to a `code --goto` that returns in ten
milliseconds blacks the screen out for no reason, and on a slow start it reads as a crash.

### The timeline

`--search` greps a string across every stored run. The history list is every run in order.
Neither of them is *"how has `test` been going"*, and that is the question you actually have
when something that used to work does not. The manifests have held the answer since the
archive existed; nothing asked them for it.

A timeline is one task's stored appearances, newest first. Two details earn their space:

The **trend** across the header (`✓✓✓✗✗`) reads left to right, which is forwards in time and
therefore the opposite order to the list underneath it. That inconsistency is deliberate —
it is the direction every other sparkline in the world runs, and the shape of *where it
turned* is more use than a count of failures.

The **bar** is scaled to the slowest run in the list rather than to any fixed duration,
because the question is "which of these was slow" and that is a comparison within the list.
A run that took any measurable time gets at least one cell: a bar that rounds to nothing
beside a number that says 40ms is two things on one row disagreeing.

Each row names the run it was part of, because `test` reached from `task all` and `test` on
its own are the same task under different circumstances — and that is the explanation for
most surprising durations.

Building this surfaced a real bug in the archive. Run ids are `<second>-<task>`, and two
runs of the *same* task inside one second collided: the second overwrote the first. That is
exactly the pair a timeline exists to show, so a counter now disambiguates them.

### The diff

When a task fails and it passed yesterday, the useful thing is not the eight hundred lines
it printed. It is the five that are new.

Against the last **green** run rather than the last run at all: "it worked before" is the
comparison that isolates a failure, where diffing two consecutive failures usually shows
only that the timestamps moved. A task that has never passed falls back to the previous run
— that is the honest second choice rather than an error — and the header names which of the
two comparisons it made, because a diff you have mistaken for the other one is worse than no
diff.

The algorithm is Myers, which is O(ND): fast exactly when the two sides are similar, which
is the case worth being fast for. Common prefix and suffix are stripped first, and that is
not only an optimisation — build logs are mostly identical run to run, so trimming turns
almost every real input into the cheap case. Past a bounded edit distance there is no useful
alignment left to find, and the fallback says so by showing both sides in full rather than
producing a plausible-looking alignment of two unrelated logs.

Before Myers sees anything, the lines that appear exactly once on each side anchor the
alignment, in the longest order the two sides agree on — patience diff — and Myers only
fills the gaps between anchors. Trimming alone was not enough for logs that differ all the
way through, which is what two `go test` runs are when every package line carries its own
timing: two 20,000-line logs cost a 145MB trace, ran past the bound and came back as every
line deleted and every line added. A line unique to both sides is the same line, and pinning
those first leaves Myers a few short gaps. The result is not always the smallest edit
script; for logs it is the more readable one, which is the same trade `git diff --patience`
makes.

Shared stretches are elided to a `⋮`, because the entire value of the view is that it is
short. A diff of two 800-line logs differing in five places is 800 rows of which 790 are
noise.

From a timeline the comparison looks back to the *turn*: the most recent earlier run that
ended differently. The trend in the header is `✓✓✓✗✗`, and the question that shape puts in
your head is what happened at the transition — where diffing against the row immediately
below answers "nothing changed" on the newest of three consecutive failures. True, useless,
and precisely where the question was most worth asking.

A stored run being diffed has to skip *itself* in the archive: it is in there, it is the
newest, and a diff of a thing against itself is a diff of nothing — which you would find out
by producing it.

## Predicting, ranking, and letting go

### Saying why a task did not run

`⇧R` — re-run with `--force` — exists because `r` coming back green without having run
anything is confusing. That key was a workaround for a missing explanation.

go-task always had the answer and always printed it. It announces `task: Task "x" is up to
date` on a line with no `[name]` prefix, so under `--output prefixed` it is attributed to
whichever task was last active — the *parent* — and lands several rows from the `⏸` it
explains. Copying the reason onto the task it names is the whole fix. The line itself stays
where go-task put it, because it is real output.

Two bugs surfaced while wiring that up, both from the same class: the check ran on one of the
two paths a line can take into storage. A line completing an unterminated one returns early,
so a check placed after that branch reads only the lines that arrived whole — and the first
of two consecutive skips was explained while the second was not, purely by which was which.
The other was a trailing carriage return from the pty defeating an anchored match.

`--list-all --json` carries `up_to_date` as well, which turns the explanation into a
prediction: the detail panel can say `would run — but go-task says it is up to date` before
you press anything. That listing also carries each task's file and line, which is what makes
`e` open a task's own definition — a note in the task package predicted exactly this and
prescribed the fix, because the JSON form is fifty-six times slower on a workspace with many
`sources:` globs and must not block the first frame. It is fetched on a background goroutine.

### Self time

Every task already carries its own clock and the run view already shows it, beside the task,
in tree order. That answers "is this step slow" and not "what makes this take four minutes",
which is a question about the whole run at once — a sort, not a walk.

Ranking by duration does not work. A `task all` that invokes six things has a duration equal
to the sum of theirs, so every aggregate outranks every task that did any work and the
profile confidently reports that `all` is the slow one. Subtracting the children leaves the
time a task spent on its own commands, which is the time that would actually go away if you
made it faster. `all` then sits at the bottom with its inclusive figure beside it.

Bars scale to the slowest row rather than the run's total: on a run where one step takes nine
tenths of the time, bars against the total leave every other row blank, and the comparison
between *those* rows is the one still worth making.

A live profile keeps up, and the cursor follows its task rather than its index — the list is
sorted by time, so rows overtake each other as the numbers move, and an index-holding cursor
would drift onto whatever slid underneath it.

### Flaky means the same commit

Alternating outcomes only *suggest* flakiness. The obvious explanation for a task that failed
and then passed is that somebody fixed it, and nothing in the archive could tell those apart
— so each run now records the git revision it happened at, and flaky is defined as both
outcomes at one commit. That is not suggestive of anything; it is the thing itself.

Runs from a dirty tree are excluded rather than included with a caveat. Two runs of
uncommitted work are not two runs of the same code, and calling them flaky would be wrong.

### Marks

Slots have held six concurrent runs since they existed, and every one of them had to be
started by going back to the picker and remembering which two you had already done. Marking
is the missing half: choose the set, then start it.

A batch containing anything dangerous asks once, naming the offenders. Asking per task would
put a modal prompt between each pair of starts, which is not a confirmation, it is an
obstacle course. More marks than free slots starts what it can and says what it left —
silently doing less than you asked is worse than refusing.

### Detaching

This sat in *Not built yet* on the assumption that a run could not survive taskui, and that
making one survive needed a supervisor process.

That assumption was wrong, and testing it rather than reasoning about it is what settled it.
The child is already a session leader in its own process group with the pty slave as its
controlling terminal. SIGKILL taskui and the run keeps going, reparented to init, still doing
work — writes to a pty whose master has closed return EIO, which every shell that matters
ignores. So detaching needs to change exactly one thing: quitting stops signalling it.

What it cannot do is keep showing the output. Once taskui exits the master is closed and
everything printed after that is gone. Which is why detaching archives what it has at that
moment: it is the last point at which the run's output can be written down at all, since a
detached run has no end to wait for.

`x` still reaches a detached run. Detaching is not a promise never to stop it — it is the
blanket that no longer covers it.

### Two columns of depth

Every row spends exactly two columns saying where it sits, whatever it puts in them. That is
what keeps every label in the same place, and it is the constraint the tree drawing has to
work inside.

A group used to spend both on its fold marker and a space, at every depth. So a namespace
one level down and a namespace at the top rendered *byte-identically*: in a Taskfile with
`backend:migrate:*`, the row for `migrate` was indistinguishable from the row for `deploy`
beside it, and the only thing saying one was nested was a header several rows up that
scrolls away. The tree stopped being a tree exactly where it got deep enough to need to be
one.

A group below the top now spends the first column on its branch and the second on its fold
marker — `├▸`, against a leaf's `├ ` and a top-level group's `▸ `. Same two columns, and the
three cases are now three shapes.

The other alignment this cost: a group's task count sits hard against the right edge, which
pushed everything else in the signal block four columns left. So the ✓/✗ landed in one place
on a leaf and another on a namespace, and the column the eye runs down looking for what is
broken zigzagged — which is most of what that column is for. Rows without a count reserve its
width now, but only when they have something to line up; a row showing no outcome would
rather spend the space on its description.

## Pivots as values

The package comment claimed from the start that grouping was "a pivot, not a set of bespoke
views: one flat list of tasks plus a key function". It was a claim with exactly two
implementations behind a two-valued enum and a `Toggled()` method, which is not an extension
point — it is a boolean wearing a name.

A pivot is a value now: a name and a builder. `p` cycles rather than toggles, fold state is
kept per pivot name rather than per enum label, and `--dump` takes any of them.

Two of the three built-ins keep bespoke builders, because they have shapes a plain path
cannot express — the domain tree folds a root-level task into its own namespace, and the
verb tree sets singletons loose at the top level. The third, `file`, is a path pivot, and it exists because the
JSON listing added for jump-to-definition already carries where every task is written. It
had been in this file's *Not built yet* section for that whole time.

### Grouping is what is inside what; ordering is what is above what

Those are two questions, and for a long time only one of them had an answer you could
change. Each pivot sorted its own nodes its own way: domain alphabetically with subgroups
sunk below the leaves beside them, verb by group size with the bare aggregate hoisted above
its own fan-out, path pivots alphabetically with what they could not place pushed last.
Three rules, in three
functions, none of them nameable and none of them yours — which is why the order read as
arbitrary. It was not arbitrary. It was just nobody's decision in particular.

They are one comparator now, and the differences between them are data on the node:

- **Rank** is for rows whose position is part of what the pivot *means* rather than a matter
  of taste — the unnamespaced tasks opening the domain tree, the ungrouped ones closing any
  tree that has them, a verb group's own aggregate sitting directly above its fan-out so the
  pivot doubles as a preview of what `task lint` will do. A Rank beats the key you are
  sorting on, because none of those three is a preference — with one exception. The two
  *hoists* give way to an order you named, because a hoist is the pivot saying "read this
  first" and that only outranks a sort key while you are reading the pivot the way it means
  to be read. Ask for `recent` and you are asking what you just ran; the hoist has no view on
  that and was answering it anyway. The *sink* does not give way, and the asymmetry is the
  point: it is not a claim about recency that a better answer displaces, it is the grouping
  admitting it had nothing to say — and since leaves sort above groups, dropping it would put
  the rows the pivot could not place at the top rather than merely un-sinking them.
- **Natural** is the order a grouping wants to be read in when the config has no opinion, and
  it is a property of the grouping rather than of the reader: `verb` in alphabetical order is
  worth nothing, since the entire point of transposing the tree is to surface the concerns
  you did not already know to look for.
- **Facets** are what there is to compare, aggregated over a subtree: a group is as recent as
  its most recent task and as broken as its worst one. A fold has to be able to tell you
  whether there is anything in there worth opening, or the ordering stops at the top level.

The payoff is not that the code is shorter. It is that `sort:` had somewhere to go — the
config names a key, one comparator reads it, and every pivot including the ones a project
wrote itself obeys it without knowing the feature exists. The three old rules survive as the
zero value, so a config that says nothing gets the tree it has always got.

One interaction is worth stating because it looks like a bug: `groups: last` is asked before
the sort key, so with `sort: recent` a namespace holding the run that just finished still
sits below every plain task beside it. That is the honest consequence of two independent
settings rather than a special case to paper over, and `groups: mixed` is the answer — which
is why the annotated config says so next to both keys.

### Two extension mechanisms, and the one that was asked for

The obvious answer to "make it extensible" in Go is `plugin.Open`, and it does not work
here. A plugin needs the host built by the same toolchain version, against identical
versions of every shared dependency, with matching build flags, and it needs cgo. taskui's
releases are built `CGO_ENABLED=0`, and in such a binary every `plugin.Open` returns
`plugin: not implemented` — that is not a limitation to work around, it is the whole feature
being absent. `-trimpath` would break it again even with cgo on. A Go plugin would work only
for someone who compiled taskui themselves, on that machine, that afternoon: precisely the
person who could have edited the source instead.

So: a regular expression for the common case, and an external command for everything else.

The regex form exists because what teams actually want to group by is their own naming
convention, and a pattern with captures is the shortest honest way to say one. The command
form exists because anything else — ownership from a CODEOWNERS file, cost from a billing
API, whatever — is a question this program cannot anticipate and should not try to.

The command protocol is the smallest thing that could work: names in on stdin, `name<TAB>
path/segments` back on stdout. Nothing to link against, no ABI, and it can be written in
whatever the team already uses.

Two things make it affordable. It is asked about the *whole* task list rather than the
visible one — a filter changes what is shown and cannot change where a task belongs — which
means the answer can be cached against the list, which means `Rebuild` on every keystroke of
a filter does not spawn a process. And it is bounded by a timeout, because a hung pivot
would hang the UI with it. A program that is missing, fails, or times out leaves every task
ungrouped and listed: a grouping that cannot answer should leave a usable list, not an empty
one.

## What runs a namespace

The domain tree's one blind spot, and the reason `--lint` had a monopoly on the answer.

`backend:fmt`, `web:fmt` and a root `fmt` that gathers them are three rows in two places:
the namespaces have the work, the top level has the thing you actually type. Splitting on
`:` puts the namespaces in front of you and files the gatherer somewhere else, so standing
at `backend` there was no way to see that anything above ran it — the verb pivot showed the
relationship, but only by leaving the tree you were reading.

The namespace's row says it now, in the column descriptions start in: `▸ backend  ↑ fmt lint
test`. Three decisions in that:

**The header, not rows inside it.** A row per aggregate per namespace was the first shape,
and on a Taskfile with six aggregates it puts six near-identical rows above every namespace's
real tasks — and raises three questions the tree had no answer to, about whether such a row
counts towards the fold's total, what marking it does, and which of the two copies a jump
lands on. The question is one you ask *of a fold before you open it*, so it belongs on the
fold.

**Reachability, not names**, which is `internal/cover`'s whole argument: `lint` never calls
`api:lint`, it calls `api:check`, which reaches `api:tenant:lint` two levels down. It is the
same grid `--lint` prints, read the other way up — the linter asks what an aggregate misses,
the picker asks what runs a namespace, and those are one set of cells transposed. Computing
them separately would be two chances to disagree about what covered means, which is why the
check moved out of `cmd/lint.go` the moment a second caller existed.

**Late, and silent until it lands.** A `--summary` is a process spawn, an aggregate's graph
is dozens of them, and a Taskfile worth checking has a dozen aggregates. Nothing waits for
it. Before it arrives the row says nothing rather than saying nothing runs this — the two are
different answers, and only one of them is worth drawing.

## Four small things

**Completion that completes something.** cobra hands over `taskui completion zsh` for free,
and what it hands over completes flag names — which you can already read in `--help`. The
hundred task names in somebody else's Taskfile are the part you cannot, and discovery is
already a function. Wiring it up found its own bug immediately: Go runs a package's init
functions in file-name order, so `completion.go` ran before `root.go` had registered any
flags, and `RegisterFlagCompletionFunc` against a flag that does not exist yet fails. Silently,
if you let it — a completion that offers nothing looks exactly like a shell that has none.

**Re-running what failed.** After a red `task all` you want the three tasks that broke, not
the pipeline. The subtlety is that an aggregate is *reported* as failed because its child
was, so the naive reading of the status map re-runs everything — which is the thing the key
exists to avoid. Only the tasks with no failed task beneath them actually broke.

**A bell.** A run finishing while you are elsewhere changes a column and nothing else. The
rule is narrow on purpose: it rings only for a run that ended while you were *not* watching
it, because a run you watched finish needs no announcing, and the whole reason to want one is
that you walked away. It rings once per run — a finished run stays finished, and polling it
forty times a second is not forty pieces of news. The byte goes out from a Bubble Tea command
rather than from the model: Update is the only thing allowed to touch the terminal, and a
stray write lands in the middle of a frame.

**Scoping the archive search.** Grepping every stored run is the right default and the wrong
thing to do twice. `--task` and `--since` were already answerable from the manifests, which
carry the task name and the start time.

### A wheel that scrolled the wrong thing

taskui never asked the terminal for mouse events, so the terminal kept the wheel. In a
normal terminal that is invisible — the alternate screen has no scrollback to move — but
inside a Neovim terminal buffer it is loud: Neovim's rule is that mouse events go to a
program that has asked for them and are handled as ordinary buffer input otherwise, so a
notch over the picker scrolled Neovim's own view of the buffer, back through frames taskui
had already replaced. The tool looked like it was ignoring the mouse. It had never heard
about it.

Asking is one line, and what to do with the answer is the whole question. The answer here is
that scrolling *is* arrowing: a wheel notch is one up or one down through the same
`handleKey` every keystroke goes through. Every screen already answers up and down — picker,
run, history, timeline, diff, profile, and the jump and search prompts each in their own way
— so one branch in `Update` scrolls all of them, and nothing that hangs off arrowing has to
be reimplemented for the mouse. Scrolling away from a running task stops following it
because that is already what `k` does.

Two things do not follow from "forward the wheel". A confirmation reads every key that is
not `y` as "no", so the wheel is dropped while one is up — a question that vanished because
the mouse moved is a question nobody answered. And asking for mouse events costs
drag-to-select, since a terminal forwarding the mouse to a program is not selecting text with
it. That is a real trade rather than a strict improvement, which is why `mouse:` is a config
key and why its comment names the cost instead of only the feature.

### A column that only one pivot could keep

The picker gives a task's label seventeen columns and its description everything after. The
domain pivot never tests that, because its labels are single segments — `check`, `migrate`.
The verb and custom pivots show whole colon paths, and `backend:migrate:control:check` is
twenty-nine, so the description started wherever the name happened to end and the signals
were squeezed off the end of the row: `✓ 9h ago` rendered as `✓ 9h`.

A name that does not fit keeps the row to itself now, and its description starts on the next
one in the column it belongs to — reusing the continuation rows that a wrapped description
already had. Every description starts in the same place again, which is the entire reason
there is a column.

## A manual that had gone two rewrites stale

`taskui.1` ships in every release archive and in the Homebrew cask, and the README told
people twice that it covered the options. Its header said `taskui 0.1.1` — the Rust version —
and it was missing eight flags, all three subcommands, and the whole pivots, bell and
`--since` surface. Nobody had touched it since the initial commit.

The interesting part is that this is the same failure the rest of the project spends effort
avoiding, and had simply not been noticed in one place. `?` and the footer read from one
keymap table so they cannot disagree. `taskui examples` renders its frames rather than
storing them so they cannot go stale. The man page did neither.

So the reference sections are generated between markers — OPTIONS from the flag set,
COMMANDS from cobra's tree, KEYS from the same table the other two surfaces read — and a test
regenerates the file and compares. `task man` is the fix when it fails. The prose stays
hand-written, because the notes on peek windows, credentials and stopping are not derivable
from anything and are most of the page's value.

Two things fell out. The generator was nondeterministic: cobra adds its `completion` command
during `Execute` rather than at construction, so the output gained or lost a subcommand
depending on whether anything had run first — which showed up as a test that passed or failed
by ordering. And `--config`'s help names its default, so the generated page carried whichever
home directory ran the generator; it is written back as `~`.

Regenerating also caught a stale entry in the keymap table itself, which meant `?` was wrong
too: `p` was still described as toggling "by domain / by verb" after it had become a cycle
through three built-ins plus whatever the config adds.

## What a 1.0 has to settle

A major version is a promise not to break things, so the question is what would be regretted.
Four answers, and one of them was a bug.

**`--run` did not exit with the task's status.** It printed `exit 1` and returned 0, while
the manual had always promised the opposite. A CI step calling `taskui --run ci` on a broken
pipeline went green. There is no worse shape for a bug: not a crash, not a wrong number on
screen, but a silent yes where the answer was no. It carries the status through now, which
for go-task's own errors is in the 200s.

**The archive had no version.** It is the one thing here that users accumulate and cannot
regenerate, and its shape stops being ours the moment there are archives in the wild. Old
runs still load — but only because every field added so far happened to be `omitempty`, which
is care rather than policy, and it holds only while changes are additive. A reader that meets
a version it does not know skips that run: an old binary garbling a newer archive is worse
than one saying it cannot read it.

**Three exit codes, distinct and written down.** `--flaky` used to share its code with "there
is no Taskfile here", so a script could not tell a finding from a failure — which is the
distinction an exit code exists to draw. `diff` and `grep` both separate the two; so does this
now.

**What is public.** `--keys` and `--phase` look like test affordances, and the temptation was
to hide them. But they are in the README, in EXAMPLES.md and in this project's own Taskfile,
which makes them interface already — so they are committed to rather than withdrawn, and
`--keys` help that still described `g` as the pivot key, two rewrites after it stopped being
one, is fixed.

What is deliberately *not* settled: the pivot command protocol and the `pivots:` config block
are days old with no users but their author. Freezing an interface nobody has bent is how a
v2 gets written. They should stay in a 0.x until somebody else has tried them.

## Not built yet

- **A binary-based formula.** Releases now carry prebuilt binaries, but the tap still
  compiles from source. Pointing the formula at those archives per platform would make
  `brew install` instant instead of a minute.
- **A Homebrew tap of prebuilt bottles.** The release builds Linux and macOS binaries for
  both architectures already; a tap that pours them would beat building from source.
- A file pivot. `location.taskfile` is already parsed and would answer "where do I edit
  this", which the domain tree gets wrong for `sec:*` and `wt:*`.
- An explicit production marker in the Taskfile to replace the `⚠` heuristic.
- Shift+space, or any other modified key, as a binding. Terminals send the same byte for
  space and shift+space; telling them apart needs the kitty keyboard protocol, which Bubble
  Tea v1 does not decode. Fold-everything lives on `⇧O` and `⇥`, which now say so in the
  footer — the request was really a discoverability bug.
- Diffing two runs of a task that are not adjacent — the timeline can only compare a run
  with the one below it, and "against the run from before the refactor" needs a mark.
- Normalising timestamps and durations out of a diff. Today they show as changes, because
  they are; a log where every line carries a timestamp diffs as entirely new.
- Incremental archiving. Detaching writes a snapshot, but a run that is still going only
  reaches the archive when you ask it to.
- Following a detached run's output after taskui restarts. It keeps running; its output does
  not keep arriving anywhere, and that needs a supervisor holding the pty.
- A pivot that groups by something the archive knows — slowest first, failing first. The
  data is there; the difficulty is that it changes under you as runs finish, and a list that
  reorders while you read it is worse than one that is merely static.

### Interactive tasks

`wrangler`, `terraform` and friends ask questions. Under `--output prefixed` such a task
**hangs with a blank screen**: go-task's prefixer is itself line-based, so a
`Proceed? (y/n) ` with no trailing newline is held inside it and never reaches taskui at
all. Measured — the prompt does not appear under `prefixed`, does appear under
`interleaved`.

So a start can go out interactively, with `--output interleaved`: `^t` in the args prompt
for a task started from the list, `⇧I` to re-run one from the run view. The prompt then
surfaces, and `i` in the run view forwards keystrokes to the task's terminal — `y`, `⏎`,
arrows, `^C`, `^D` — with `esc` to stop typing.

`i` works on an *ordinary* run too. go-task wraps stdout and stderr for prefixing but
leaves stdin alone, so keystrokes reach the child either way — verified against a real
`task` process. You may not see the question, but `y⏎` still answers it, which beats
restarting a half-finished deploy. `⇧I` is the deliberate restart for when seeing the
prompt matters more.

Because a buffered run can stay silent for a long time after you answer, the input bar
echoes what it sent:

```
  input   keys go to the task   sent: y⏎   buffered: ⏎ sends a newline, output may lag
```

Without that receipt, "I typed y and nothing happened" is indistinguishable from "y never
left the building". A write that fails says so instead of looking identical to one that
landed.

The cost is attribution. Interleaved output still carries go-task's `task: [name] <cmd>`
announcements, so lines are attributed to whichever task last spoke: correct for a
sequential run, wrong under parallel `deps:`. Interactive tasks are inherently sequential,
so the trade is worth making — but only when asked for, which is why it is a toggle rather
than the default.

It is a toggle on one start, not a mode. It used to be armed from the picker with `i`, and
`⇧I` armed it too, and it stayed armed for every run after: one `⇧I` put every later run in
interleaved mode, misattributing their output under parallel deps and archiving it that
way, with a word in the header the only sign. `--force` was the same, on `⇧F` and `⇧R`. Both
are now chosen in the prompt that composes the start, and the prompt line shows the
command with them in it.

Two things make this discoverable rather than something you have to know. A task sitting
on an unterminated line gets a `?` bar quoting the question. And a *non-interactive* run
that has produced nothing for fifteen seconds gets a warning — under `prefixed` a blocked
task emits literally nothing, so silence is the only signal that exists:

```
  …   no output for a while    if it is waiting for input: x to stop, i to re-run interactively
```

`i` on such a run re-runs it interactively rather than pretending to send keystrokes into
a void.

### Why `--output prefixed`

Measured against go-task 3.53.1. Every output line self-identifies:

```
task: [a] echo "a start"
[a] a start
[b] b start
```

That is per-line attribution with no buffering, and it survives parallel `deps:`, where
`interleaved` and `group` both emit unattributed output lines whose order tells you
nothing about which task produced them.

`group` was the obvious candidate — its `begin`/`end` templates look like fold markers —
but plain `output: group` emits no markers at all, and adding them only marks task
*completion*, which is too late to build a live tree from. It also does not buffer on this
version, contrary to
[go-task#937](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/937); that issue still reads as open
but does not reproduce here, so the argument against `group` is attribution, not latency.

Colour is the cost, and the fix is not the one you would guess. Prefixed mode makes
go-task pipe every command through its own prefixing writer, so a command's stdout is a
pipe no matter what taskui does — measured, `isatty` reports false inside prefixed mode
even with go-task itself on a pty. Tools that auto-detect turn colour off and no pty gets
it back. Forcing by environment does, so the capture sets `CARGO_TERM_COLOR=always`,
`CLICOLOR_FORCE=1` and `FORCE_COLOR=1`, which restores cargo and clippy's colour through
the pipe intact.

The pty is still worth keeping — go-task's own output stays coloured, and it avoids the
usual switch to block buffering when stdout is not a terminal — it just is not what makes
the tools colour.
